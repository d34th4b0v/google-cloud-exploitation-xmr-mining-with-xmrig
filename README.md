# google-cloud-exploitation-xmr-mining-with-xmrig

**WARNING** THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK YOU CAN GET FLAGGED INSTANTLY AND I DON'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING!!!
this can be also used in other free cloud computing services, basically the same shit different corp.

You can exploit google's cloud, they give a free cloud instance for free use it to your profit by mining on it, they don't get you for  ~3-4 days. Can earn good xmr with a few accounts, plus you can acces google cloud shell with tor so that even if they flag the IP, it doesn't matter. 

Step 1 - Install Wallet & Create Address
- Create wallet (if you're too dumb to do this, maybe this is not for you)

Step 2 - Install Mining Software on your cloud istance that google has assigned you.
- clone xmrig on your cloud
  - `git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git`

Step 3 - Configure the confif.json file
- cd into xmrig, you will see a json file, you can edit the configs with this, simply nano into it (`nano config.json`)
- put your wallet address where it says to put it.
- set the mining pool, set the diff at low, these cloud instances don't have much (that's why you make multiple
google cloud accounts by spoofing details and using VoIP numbers)

Step 4 - Start mining!
- you might have to chmod or bash it 

Step 5 - After some time you will have mined enough xmr to withdraw, To do this 
go to the mining pool's website that you used, enter your address that u used to mine,
and withdraw.
